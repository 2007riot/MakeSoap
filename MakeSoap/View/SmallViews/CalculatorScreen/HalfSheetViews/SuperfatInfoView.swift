If you use 0 % superfat you have a big chance to have lye leftovers in the soap, because individual plants and oils can vary with their saponification values. Adding too much superfat can leave a greasy feel on the skin.")

                Text("In hot process soap you can add extra oils after the soap has cooked. These oils wonâ€™t react with the lye, because the saponification is finished, so you can choose different oils to enrich the soap.")
